def flatten_and_sort(array):

# How does this solution ensure data immutability?

# This solution ensures data immutability by not modifying the original input array. It creates a new list arr to store the flattened and sorted elements, leaving the original array unchanged.



# Is this solution a pure function? Why or why not?

# Yes, this solution is a pure function because it:
# - Always produces the same output for the same input.
# - It doesn't modify external state or variables.
# - Relies only on its input parameter to produce the output.



# Is this solution a higher order function? Why or why not?

# No, this solution is not a higher-order function. A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result. The flatten_and_sort function takes only one argument and does not operate on functions.



# Would it have been easier to solve this problem using a different programming style?

# While it's possible to solve this problem using different programming styles such as imperative or object-oriented, functional programming is well-suited for this task because it emphasizes immutability, separation of concerns, and expressing operations as a series of transformations on data.


# Why in particular is functional programming a helpful paradigm when solving this problem?

# Functional programming is helpful for this problem because it encourages a declarative and composable approach. You can break down the problem into smaller, more focused functions such as flattening and sorting, and then compose them to achieve the desired result.
